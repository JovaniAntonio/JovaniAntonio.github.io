Test

# Lab 8
My favorite lab was lab number 8 part 2. I really enjoyed writing the code for the secret message and found it interesting on how you could setup a secret word.
It was my first time understanding how to use ofstream and then saving the secret message to a file. I also had better understanding on how to set a vector string command.

# Lab 9
Lab 9 part 3 is one that I won't forget about as had so much fun creating a simple color gradient image.
