### CPSC 120

Test

# Lab 8
My favorite lab was lab number 8 part 2. I really enjoyed writing the code for the secret message and found it interesting on how you could setup a secret word.
It was my first time understanding how to use ofstream and then saving the secret message to a file. I also had better understanding on how to set a vector string command.

# Lab 9
Lab 9 part 3 is one that I won't forget about as had so much fun creating a simple color gradient image. I had a fun time creating different gradients with different colors.
I was having a blast learning how RGB can be used to make certain colors. Being able to color certain rows and columns made it easier to understand what I was doing. 

# Lab 12
Lab 12 was probably the most statisfying lab yet. In class we were able to work together and animate a gradient gif file. This had a very nice list of prompts to follow as well.
I had no difficulty setting up the code as the instructions were clear. I believe lab 12 was a good test on showing what we learned within the last few weeks of Cpsc120 Lab.
